# Chasing Tail  
#### *(insert off color joke here)*[^3]

### Anti-surveilance tool used to help discover and evade any unkown agents.

###### The device is able to enumerate and record unique wireless signals in close proximity over long distances and/or long periods of time by utilizing kismet, a raspberry pi or similar (eg orange pi, rock pi, or Android TV BOX w/ linux installed), various antennai, GPS tracking, and a power source, in an effort to log various devices that have open connections to the internet so that their discover, presence, and relative distance can be made known. The devices targeted by the device includes, but not limited to, cell phones, laptops, IoT devices, or any device with internet capabilities that might be found on, in, or around an unkown entity that engages in surveilance. 

### You might be under surveilance if...

###### For whatever reason you have gone and gotten the attention of local law enforcement, as such they have taken a keen interest in your comings and goings, social entanglements, etc etc. SOP involves a plain clothes, undercover officer, following you at a distance to record and witness where you are going and who you are going to see. This device loggs every device that connects to the internet around you and should the same device constantly make an appearance over a certain amount of time and over a certainn distance it is safe to assume that that device belongs to the very people that are trying desperately to avoid such attention and you are now armed with the knowledge of their presence and have the ability to either change your destination(s) and/or change your route in order to make it extremely difficult to follow. A left blinker before turning right, a last minute running of a red light, or just plain 'ol speeding are all valid methods of maintaining your relative anonymnity when in public. 


###### In reality this device is an ignorance removal apparatus. The veil of ignorance is lifted with the utilization of data and information given directly to the end user. Rather poetic, is it not? 

###### This repo is a fork of the original[^1] and not a work of my own genius I am just a witness and opportunist who saw it's potential and had the means to replicate it and use it for myself.[^2]
